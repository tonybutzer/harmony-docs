# Week 10 - We are Really on to SOmething Here:

- synergies between the cloud and hpc
- high speed data movement
- Remote Sensing Catalogs of pixels at our service
    - Sentinel L2A
    - old Landsat 8 TOA
    - brand new USGS Collection2 - Surface Reflectance in UTM
        - coming soon Albers
    - nearFuture Suomi NPP will carry five science instruments 
        - Suomi NPP is the first satellite mission to address the challenge of acquiring a wide range of land, ocean, and atmospheric measurements 
- Synergies with google maps and geojson.io
- NO LICENSE FEES
- A support group and a PANGEO community with really smart people to cheat off
- A talented pool of folks from SD Universities - pride
- Scientists with noble missions - wonderful!
- We can write `our own apps` that do just what we want them to do!
- get rid of WINDOWS and all of its poor engineering.

## Composite Work


## Simple Animations using Landsat-8 TOC


## Denali integration Scenarios

- composite on AWS --- Characterize on Denali or Tallgrass
- Water Evaporation and Runoff on AWS --- Evaluate Water Balance Model fidelity on Denali using Stream Guage Data
