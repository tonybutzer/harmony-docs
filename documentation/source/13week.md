# Week 13 - day in the life of ETa

## Community Interest
- Looking at Pangeo and Docker on HPC
    - Could support nice hybrid soultions between the cloud and HPC(s) Denali, Tallgrass
    - need to examine Singularity and Shifter on the HPC
    - I may call my orchestration method - manual_transmission :-)
- Tony prefers scaling with docker versus other methods - Why:
    - MPI – Message Passing Interface¶
        - Distributed Memory Systems
        - More difficult to parallelize
        - Requires a change in fundamental programming


## Community Case Studies
- VegET in the cloud
    - Cloud Scaling
    - Model validation without ARC tools
    - Simple Visualizations
    - Pathfinder project for other cloud enthusiasts
- ETa pipeline from SSEBoP (Google Earth Engine)
    - Pushing data into a Dark Repo
        - Web Interface for endusers
        - Many data users just want direct access to COGs
