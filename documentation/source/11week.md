# Week 11

> One of the advantages of doing science in general in the cloud is the potential to facilitate interagency collaboration in terms of people and data sets. That is a fundamental objective of new analysis environments coming on the scene, such as PANGEO and Open Data Cube. And because these are open source, they can operate on any cloud or on-prem platform. In late 2019, we (NLI, EROS, and CHS folks) began discussing these kinds of joint development opportunities with NASA and NOAA, which are continuing. That’s a pretty exciting prospect for EROS.” -- Pete Doucette ![https://www.usgs.gov/center-news/doucette-discusses-future-eros-science-earthmap-new-branch-chief](https://www.usgs.gov/center-news/doucette-discusses-future-eros-science-earthmap-new-branch-chief)

## Brave Sir Logan and The CMR 
- Common Metadata Repository (CMR) - Earthdata - NASA
- Logan says register here:
    - I think you just need an earth data log in 
    - https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/


## geojson.io and google - measure distances - klm 

- demo cut and paste into geojson.io
- talk about importing as a kml in google maps
- all you need is a chromebook to do science.
