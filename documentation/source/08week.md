# WEEK 8
## Intro Paragraph
> for next tuesdays class - I am working on a simplified waubay example using landsat-8 only from a mature catalog as well as more explanations on pandas, xarray, and STAC catalogs - we will have some AI plans and composite plans in Git that I will glide thru as well ... more to come. lots of training and practical examples are emerging ... some data wrangling for Steffi as well

## Overview

- git
- data to be organized properly in the cloud
    - Collection-2 STAC and sat-search improvements
    - Albers with STAC and sat-search
- data we are playing with
    - landsat-pds - Landsat 8 public data set - sponsored by Planet and AWS
- HLS (BOF) birds-of-a-feather working group
    - Need to have Cole K go thru his notebook and what he knows - Aaron Friez as well

## Simplifed Waubay

    - uses sat-search
    - Dinesh this is a good way to play with moving the AOI


## Git Repo Tour


## Validating Input Data via YML Config
    - Pandas
