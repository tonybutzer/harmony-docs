Tony, I discovered something by Accident today.   If you add use "panel" as your urlpath in binder, it displays all your notebooks with Panel as apps.    Check out the last binder link here:

    Ooh this is cool too!    https://edu.oggm.org/en/latest/explorer.html

[Yesterday 12:44 PM] Signell, Richard P
    Tony, check out Ryan's book! https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro
​[Yesterday 12:44 PM] Signell, Richard P
    It's not really a book.   It's actually a course.  He describes how he "onboards" folks to Pangeo (essentially)

    And then look at the Capstone project list: https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/projects.html

    This came up in the discussion here: https://github.com/pangeo-data/jupyter-earth/issues/11#issuecomment-740059579
A curated list of learning resources  · Issue #11 · pangeo-data/jupyter-earthFollowing up from the EarthCube meeting on Sept 10, one item that came to light was that it would be valuable to have a curated / opinionated list of learning resources to onboard scientists to the...github.com​[Yesterday 12:47 PM] Butzer, Tony (Contractor)
    that sounds perfect - this 2nd mouse approach feels nice
​[Yesterday 12:47 PM] Signell, Richard P
    I love that the students all did projects using the tools and have binder links!
​[Yesterday 12:48 PM] Butzer, Tony (Contractor)
    Neal Pastick is already a pangeo zealot - got is aws space today!
​[Yesterday 12:48 PM] Butzer, Tony (Contractor)
    we will be talking to neal - you will be a consultant on our data wrangling pipeline
​[Yesterday 12:53 PM] Signell, Richard P
    Sounds good!



2. LAB
3. Organizing our DATA Inputs in the Cloud
	- Fundamentals of S3
	- S3 is an object store
		- mostly not a big deal - but sometimes ...
	- Data Wrangling
	- Slow Data Transfers
		- ssh and scp
	- VPN do's and dont's

## Project Initiation, Kickoff, and Approach

- Jump in with both feet approach.
- Gabriel Senay, Steffi Kagone - trail blazers
- Neal Pastick as trail blazer
- Continuous Training - Train The trainer
    - Example Steffi and Gabe Parish now writing visualizations directly

## Cloud Immersion Concept

### Use the cloud for EVERYTHING
- website
- kanban
- jupyter hub  - mini-pangeos
- all your data storage
    - move from clunky Netapps and archaic windows storage architectures
- leverage others work
- collaborate like hell

## Why

### For selfish reasons

- Impress your friends
- looks nice on the resume
- its more fun
- you don't have to deal with people you don't like

### Headlines

- Netflix Delivers Billions of Hours of Content Globally by Running on AWS 
- Steffi Kagone does 150 days of work in just THREE!

### Procurement delays not applicable

### Scalability

### USGS/DOI Efficiencies
- Remember DCOI threats
- Remember Cloud First
- Used to be mandates as a top down push
- Now science customer pull
- cost efficiencies
- It is irresponsible not to use the cloud

### Open Source Advantages
- numerous articles on why open source

### Python Momentum

### My favorite - less data wrangling - MORE SCIENCE
