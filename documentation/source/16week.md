# Week 16 - Welcome Landfire

Today we welcome the Landfire, FireScience team to this community of best practices and this community of sharing, notebooks, concepts, code , data and most importantly - non-silo-ed talent. Welcome Tolk, Brian (Contractor) L  -- and Degaga, Erica J
 
## What is this class?
1. A community of cloud based Scientists that:
    - use the cloud
    - some have custom cloud accounts
    - some use the Landsat account
    - some use thebigPangeo
    - some have their own mini-Pangeos/jupyterHubs/sandboxes
    - 
2. Notable technologies
    - Python
    - Open Source
    - Image Processing and GIS
        - xarray, pandas, matplotlib, holoviews, geoviews, geopandas, rasterio, GDAL
3. Remote Sensing Cloud Stored assets
    - Landsat - utm/albers/ ---> ARD tiles
    - Sentinel-2-COGs
    - Hamonized Landsat Sentinel

## Teams
1. Evapotranspiration -- Water - Steffi, Olena
2. Land Cover - Brett, Pat, Kory
3. LCMAP - Kelcy
4. Invasive - Sujan, Devandra, Logan, Neal
5. Web Development Team - Claudia, Maxwell, Michelle, Balu ...
6. VegDyn - Trent, Dinesh
7. Emerging AI experts ...


> Basically, ostensibly- lots of superior TALENT

## A group of experts 

- here are just a few - there are many i have not enumerated and some i have not yet discovered

1. Logan Megard - HLS
2. Steffi Kagone - Converting Models from ARCPY to rasterio
3. Olena Boiko - Data Wrangling Expert - MOdel QA Expert - Jupyter/matplotlib
4. Kelcy Smith - Python Expert, Jupyter Expert, time-series expert - STAC expert
5. Nathan Roberts - user service - data management 

## Today
Today I am privileged to have guest instructors:
Kagone, Stefanie (Contractor) -- and -- Boiko, Olena are back for an encore lesson on how to use the bigPangeo - pangeo.chs.usgs.gov to look at refining the sophistication of the model by improving the fidelity of NDVI.  
 
also ...
Danielson, Patrick (Contractor) -- and -- Postma, Kory (Contractor) will give an opinionated demo of a notebook on STAC meets one of the mature STAC Catalogs for Sentinel-2-COGs.
 
We can talk a little about the data wrangling and scp and rclone we have been doing between the Netapp, Caldera and S3.
 
And we can talk about finding Albers Scenes for Landsat Compositing using the young, immature Landsat Stac Catalog.
 
Nathan Roberts and Rich Signell are both presenting Pangeo/OpenDataCube papers at conferences this month.
 
So the folks attending this class are Early Adopters of technology and infrastructure stacks that will revolutionize science in the next few years.

# Overview

## Steffi and Olena
#### Modis derived NDVI an Land Surface Temperature
- Uses the big pangeo
- uses R**2 to evaluate hypothesis
- ran in a $200 mini-pangeo - now runs in the freeFREEfree https://pangeo.chs.usgs.gov

## Pat and Kory
- so far many have come up to speed with Jupyter Lab/Notebook quickly
    - The ability to share snippets of code, concepts, visualizations - is a gamechanger
    - Jupyter is not a full-blown IDE - i say so what!
- these few weeks will look at composites with HLS, sentinel and Landsat - starting with data discover via STAC.

## quit hiding your code and data -
### From Kindergarten

```
Share everything.

Play fair.

Don’t hit people.

Put things back where you found them.

Clean up your own mess.

Don’t take things that aren’t yours.

Say you’re sorry when you hurt somebody.

Wash your hands before you eat.
```
