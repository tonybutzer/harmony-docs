# Week 16 - Welcome Landfire

Today we welcome the Landfire, FireScience team to this community of best practices and this community of sharing, notebooks, concepts, code , data and most importantly - non-silo-ed talent. Welcome Tolk, Brian (Contractor) L  -- and Degaga, Erica J
 
Today I am privileged to have guest instructors:
Kagone, Stefanie (Contractor) -- and -- Boiko, Olena are back for an encore lesson on how to use the bigPangeo - pangeo.chs.usgs.gov to look at refining the sophistication of the model by improving the fidelity of NDVI.  
 
also ...
Danielson, Patrick (Contractor) -- and -- Postma, Kory (Contractor) will give an opinionated demo of a notebook on STAC meets one of the mature STAC Catalogs for Sentinel-2-COGs.
 
We can talk a little about the data wrangling and scp and rclone we have been doing between the Netapp, Caldera and S3.
 
And we can talk about finding Albers Scenes for Landsat Compositing using the young, immature Landsat Stac Catalog.
 
Nathan Roberts and Rich Signell are both presenting Pangeo/OpenDataCube papers at conferences this month.
 
So the folks attending this class are Early Adopters of technology and infrastructure stacks that will revolutionize science in the next few years.

# Overview

## Steffi and Olena
#### Modis derived NDVI an Land Surface Temperature
- Uses the big pangeo
- uses R**2 to eveluate hypothesis
- ran in a $200 mini-pangeo - now runs in the freeFREEfree https://pangeo.chs.usgs.gov
